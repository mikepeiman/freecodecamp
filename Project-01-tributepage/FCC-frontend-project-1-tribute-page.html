        <p class="text-center main-caption">Throughout the course of his life Fuller held 28 patents, authored 28 books, received 47 honorary degrees. And while his most well know artifact, the geodesic dome, has been produced over 300,000 times worldwide, Fuller's true impact on the world
          today can be found in his continued influence upon generations of designers, architects, scientists and artists working to create a more sustainable planet.</p>

              <blockquote>
                From now on you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth.
                <br><br>You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to Universe.
                <br><br>Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others.
              </blockquote>
              Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on <strong>"an experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity."</strong>
